Development Environment Setup
-----------------------------

1. Install Docker
  - On a Linux box or VM running Linux (CentOS 7 to match production) install [Docker|https://docs.docker.com] and [Docker Compose|https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/]
  - On a Mac [Docker for Mac|https://beta.docker.com] can be used

2. Clone the source repository
  - Note that you may want to make sure the clone is in a folder shared with the host if using a VM (or under /Users if using Docker for Mac)

3. Run setup-local.sh

4. The script should echo a URL that can be used to access the site
