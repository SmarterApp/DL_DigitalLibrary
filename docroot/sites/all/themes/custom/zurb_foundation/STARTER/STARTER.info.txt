; This section controls the CSS files for your theme. There are 3 different
; things you can do with a "stylesheets" line:
; - Add a new stylesheet for your theme.
; - Override a module's stylesheet. If the stylesheet you are adding uses the
;   same filename as a stylesheet from a Drupal core or contrib module, your CSS
;   file will be used instead of the module's file.
; - Remove a module's stylesheet. If you specify the name of a Drupal core or
;   contrib module's stylesheets, Drupal will remove that stylesheet if you do
;   NOT include a file with that name with your theme.
;
; stylesheets[MEDIA][] = FILE
;
; The "FILE" is the name of the stylesheet to add/override/remove.
; The "MEDIA" in the first set of brackets is a media type or a media query.
; Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and "handheld". A
; typical media query is "screen and (max-width: 320px)".
;
; CSS2.1 media types: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types
; CSS3 media queries: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/

; Base theme specific CSS
stylesheets[all][] = css/custom.css

; This section lists the regions defined in the page.tpl.php. The name in 
; brackets is the machine name of the region. The text after the equals sign is
; a descriptive text used on the admin/structure/blocks page.
;
; In the page.tpl.php, the contents of the region are output with a
; $page['MACHINE-NAME'] variable. For example, with this line in the .info
; file:
;   regions[header] = Header
; You'll use this variable in page.tpl.php:
;   <?php print render($page['header']); ?>

regions[header]          = Header
regions[navigation]      = Navigation
regions[help]            = Help
regions[highlighted]     = Highlighted
regions[content]         = Content
regions[sidebar_first]   = Left Sidebar
regions[sidebar_second]  = Right Sidebar
regions[footer_first]    = Footer first
regions[footer_middle]   = Footer middle
regions[footer_last]     = Footer last

; The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
; show up on the blocks administration page. But they are required in order for
; the html.tpl.php to work properly, so do not delete them.

regions[page_top]       = Page top
regions[page_bottom]    = Page bottom

; Various page elements output by the theme can be toggled on and off. The
; "features" control which of these check boxes display on the
; admin/appearance config page. This is useful for suppressing check boxes
; for elements not used by your sub-theme. To add a check box, uncomment the
; entry for it below. See the Drupal 7 Theme Guide for more info:
