           and uninstall
by teknic: fixed issue with #tree in form, removed  in submit
by teknic: changed the way we determine valid permissions (ie: roles
           that have access to moderate content)
by teknic: corrected function call and parameters to valid_roles()
by teknic: replaced submit handler with hook_node_submit, giving access
           to the node created, for token replacement
by teknic: removed #submit handler, added form[actions][submit][#submit][]
           submit handler so that the node was available, this resolves
           the issue of no NID in emails when first saved.
by teknic: renamed workbench_email.features.inc function names, fixed
           issue with role being loaded by name instead of rid
